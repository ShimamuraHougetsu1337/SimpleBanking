## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Deposit and Withdraw** features added to `AccountDetailPage` with responsive popup modals.
- Backend API endpoints `POST /transactions/deposit` and `POST /transactions/withdraw` with TypeORM transaction blocks, pessimistic locking, and idempotency key validation.
- Agent Guardrails: Added explicit project rules in `AGENTS.md` and `frontend-ui-guidelines` to enforce Clean Code/SRP and React Query Cache Invalidation.

### Changed
- Translated `TransferReviewModal` UI from Vietnamese to English to standardize language usage.
- Refactored `AccountDetailPage` component by splitting monolithic code into isolated components (`AccountQuickActions`, `AccountSettingsForm`, `AccountTransactions`) following Clean Code and SRP principles.
- Optimised network usage in frontend by aggressively utilizing `useQuery` caching (`DashboardPage`, `AccountsPage`, `AccountDetailPage`) to prevent redundant fetch calls.
- Resolved layout thrashing issue by migrating inline styles from `Sidebar` to a global stylesheet `style.css`.
- Fixed navigation logic in "Back" buttons within `AccountDetailPage` to use `navigate(-1)` instead of hardcoded paths.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- `AccountsPage` and `AccountDetailPage` to view user accounts and filter specific transaction history.`
- Dynamic layout updates to display authenticated user information in `Sidebar`, `AppLayout`, and `AdminLayout`.
- Backend endpoints `GET /accounts/me` and `GET /accounts/:id`.
- Advanced query filters for `GET /transactions` supporting `accountId`, `search`, `fromDate`, and `toDate`.
- Added `name` field to `accounts` table in the data model.

### Changed
- Refactored `DashboardPage` layout to a vertical list of accounts and their recent transactions (removed carousel and transfer button).
- Transitioned transaction filtering logic to support granular search within specific accounts.
- Removed partially completed frontend boilerplate tasks from Planned.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added
- Initialize project documentation and agent configuration assets.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Detailed system architectural overview.
- `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` — Database data model with schema mappings for users, accounts, transactions, and refresh_tokens.
- `docs/API_SPEC.md` — API specification describing endpoints for Auth, Account, Transaction, and Admin.
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — Security specification covering DB transactions, locking, idempotency, and Refresh Token Rotation.
- `docs/SEQUENCE_DIAGRAMS.md` — Mermaid sequence diagrams mapping core application flows.
- `docs/FRONTEND_GUIDE.md` — Frontend guidelines documenting routing, Zustand/React Query state architecture, and Ant Design.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` — Development setups, default credentials, CLI scripts, and troubleshooting steps.
- `.agents/AGENTS.md` — Workspace agent guardrail constraints with Prompt Routing support.
- `.agents/skills/typeorm-transaction/` — Banking database transactions patterns skill.
- `.agents/skills/nestjs-module-scaffold/` — NestJS feature/module scaffolding standards skill.
- `.agents/skills/jwt-refresh-rotation/` — JWT authentication and rotation flows skill.
- `.agents/skills/react-api-layer/` — React client-side Axios/Zustand/Query HTTP handler skill.
- `.agents/skills/docker-compose-setup/` — Dockerized container deployment settings skill.

### Technical Decisions
- **State Management**: Zustand (local/auth state) + React Query (async server state) — Redux Toolkit excluded.
- **UI Library**: Ant Design v5
- **Authentication**: JWT Access Token (15m) + Opaque Refresh Token with Rotation (7d).
- **Admin Module**: Fully required scope.
- **Currency Data Representation**: `numeric(18,2)` database type for financial figures (no floats).
- **Concurrency & Duplication Control**: Pessimistic write locking + Unique idempotency keys.
