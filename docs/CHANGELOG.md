### Technical Decisions
- **State Management**: Zustand (local/auth state) + React Query (async server state) — Redux Toolkit excluded.
- **UI Library**: Ant Design v5
- **Authentication**: JWT Access Token (15m) + Opaque Refresh Token with Rotation (7d).
- **Admin Module**: Fully required scope.
- **Currency Data Representation**: `numeric(18,2)` database type for financial figures (no floats).
- **Concurrency & Duplication Control**: Pessimistic write locking + Unique idempotency keys.
